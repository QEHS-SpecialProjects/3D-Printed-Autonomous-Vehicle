# 3D Printed Autonomous Vehicle
Computer Pathways Project

Language based on Hardware: Processing-Java Driver with Pure Java Classes
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi & an Camera

Example Applications
- Autonomous Assist in a <a href="https://blog.hackster.io/honda-driverless-shopping-cart-uses-arduinos-and-a-raspberry-pi-1e2b11212152">Shopping Cart</a>
- Timing all the Green Lights in a Row of Street lights, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/audi-glosa-green-light-connected/?CNDID=54420720&CNDID=54420720&bxid=MjgzMTkzMzg4NzA4S0&hasha=640a1a5ded96eef712bcbf00fbc8f86f&hashb=3860a97d1899fd39f9fe724a6ff964ef4559e64a&mbid=nl_022019_daily_list3_p2&source=DAILY_NEWSLETTER&utm_brand=wired&utm_mailing=WIRED%20NL%20022019%20(1)&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl">using an Audi</a>

## Planning

### Features and Sensors


Examples to Review
- Voltage Regulation & using diodes
- Using LEDs for debugging and "electrical on & able to function"
- Using H-Bridges
- Touch or Bump sensor : "in garage", "in accident so auto-off"
- Whisker Sensors
- Photosensors: line following, cliff sensing, following tail-lights, staying away from headlights (head on collisions)
- Ultrasonic | Rotating Ultrasonic: distances
- Gyroscope: "where am I"; "have I flipped over";
- Speaker: sound feedback
- Raspberry Pi Camera: front and rear for FPV
- Raspberry Pi Camera: face recognition
- Raspberry Pi Camera: image detection like street signs
- Raspberry Pi Camera: line detection like walls, sidewalks, other objects

Textbooks for Information
- Robot Building for Beginners
- Intermediate Robot Building
